## About Me
I build machine learning models as well as data analytics and data engineering projects, taking work end to end from raw data ingestion to modeling, evaluation, and insight delivery. My experience spans supervised learning and computer vision, along with large-scale ETL pipelines, API-driven data collection, and interactive dashboards. I focus on clean preprocessing, reproducible workflows, and practical implementations that translate data into usable outcomes.
