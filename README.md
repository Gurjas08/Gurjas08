## About Me
I build end-to-end machine learning and data analytics projects that go from raw data to deployable insights. My work focuses on supervised learning, computer vision, and reproducible data pipelines, with an emphasis on clean preprocessing, model evaluation, and practical use cases.

I’m currently targeting **entry-level ML / applied ML roles** where I can contribute to real-world model development and data-driven products.
